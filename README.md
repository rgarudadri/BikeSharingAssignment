# BikeSharingAssignment
>Problem Statement: 
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has a daily dataset on the rental bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. It wishes to use this data to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.
Essentially, the company wants to know â€”
    Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands
    
		
# Business Goal: 
Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

# Steps Followed:
1. Reading, Understanding, and visualizing the data
2. Preparing the data for model (train-test split)
3. Trainining the Model
4. Residual Analysis
5. Prediction & evaluation on the test
